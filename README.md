# Raspberry Ambilight Node

This package has been created for Led Strip diode control, basing on pixels that are present on screen.

This project uses WS2812 RGB led strip to display data.

Currently the package bases on getting the pixel values from screen of RPi and sending them to the diodes. For now the performance is rather poor, but I have few ideas to fix this.

Roadmap:

* Improve performance

* Add simple scalable interface to send diode data basing on different inputs (mic, sensors etc.) 

* Implement usage of uC to steer the diodes via WiFi.
